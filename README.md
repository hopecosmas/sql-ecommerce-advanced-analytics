# sql-ecommerce-advanced-analytics

In this project, we use advanced SQL techniques such as Subqueries, CTEs, VIEWs, etc to perform business analysis in order to find 
essential business metrics.
We calculated:

1. Changes over time, which helps business to see how they are doing as time goes.
2. Cumulative analysis, to see how they are doing cumulatively
3. Data segmentation, to understand how different measures correlate with each other.
4. Part-to-whole analysis, to see which business categories have the greatest impact on our business.
5. Performance analysis, to measure our business success and compare performances.


We then went on to create two business reports (customers_report & products_report) to pit together everything we have analysed 
to help other people and stakeholders see the business outcomes.
